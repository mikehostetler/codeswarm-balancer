# CodeSwarm Worker Balancer

* Standalone process. (may very easily be split into multiple process in the future if needed / 1-1 process connection)

* There are PRODUCERS (ex: codeswarm) and CONSUMERS/WORKERS (ex: worker nodes).

* When a producer connects with a new JOB, balancer will find an available worker and handshake them together until the end of the JOB

* Dockerized, run: "docker build -t codeswarm-balancer ."

### ENV Variables

* PRODUCERS_PORT - producers listening port, defaults to 5000.
* WORKERS_PORT - workers listening port defaults to 8632.
